	<p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 50px;width: 360px;">There are 3 species of birds that are native to the Santa Cruz island, one of which is the island scrub jay. The island scrub jay is threatened  because of their susceptibility to the west nile virus which is carried by mosquito species.Santa cruz island temperatures are too low to normally have  the mosquitoes but due to global warming the mosquitoes can live there and give the birds the virus.Some people are trying to find vaccines for the birds but the one they found was too expensive to use on all the birds.</p>

	<p style="position: relative;top: -600px;left: -100px;width: 400px;text-align: left;">Above this text there is a mind web. In  a  mind web there is a main word or a  category that all the other words or categories connect to  with a line.</p>

	<p style="position: relative;top: -600px;left: -100px;width: 400px;text-align: left;">How you know it is a mind web is that the mane is in the middle and everything has to connect to it or connect to something that connects to the middle. song sparrow when we were at the channel  islands there was a song sparrow specialist her name was maybelline. She told us that she worked in the song sparrow’s mating/nesting season. Why she did this is because she would catch  the song sparrow in a net when she would lower them with bird calls. Then she would tag the bird. We also learned that the song sparrow that she studies are the males.</p>
	<h3 style="position: relative;top: -600px;">The Baby Birds</h3>
	<p style="position: relative;top: -600px;text-align: left;">We were in the creek studying a dead scrub jay. When I looked up in a tree there was a nest. In the nest I saw a bird. Once she saw us, she flew away into a tree. I looked closer and saw two baby birds sitting in the nest. We started to take pictures of the nest and climb trees to get a better look at it. Some people thought that it wasn’t a bird nest because there were clumps of the same material that the bird used for it’s nest on the tree. One reason that we think that the bird used the tree is that the nest would be camouflaged  from predators like the island foxes. We noticed that the mother bird was constantly moving from tree to tree. At camp we tried to make a nest just like the one we saw in the creek. We found it very hard to make a nest and thought how long it would take a bird to make its nest.The bird species that was in the nest was identified as the Black Headed Grossbeak.</p>

	<h3 style="position: relative;top: -600px;">The Dead Scrub Jay</h3>
	<p style="position: relative;top: -600px;width: 400px;">During our adventure on santa cruz island we noticed a dead juvinall island scrub jay laying there in the creek. My group and I decided to investigate how the bird died. We put on our gloves and picked up the scrub jay. We noticed that jay died of a broken neck, earlier that day I got introduced to a scrub jay specialist named Rebeca. She informed us that other birds on the island liked to  killed other birds for fun. Rebeca told us that bigger birds would grab their necks with their talents then the big bird would snap their neck.</p>

	<h3 style="position: relative;top: -850px;">Scrub Jay</h3>
	<p style="position: relative;top: -850px;width: 600px">We went to a scrub jay preserve and learned that people at the preserve use a special sound to attract the island scrub jay for peanuts. We also learned that the island scrub jay bury acorns for winter, if their territory has oak trees.But some territories do not have oak trees. Instead they have pine trees which have pine nuts. So they bury pine nuts for winter instead of acorns. I also learned that island scrub jays are very territorial. If another scrub jay comes into their territory they would pull out all its feathers.They also have a mate for life to share their territorial with.They never leave their mate in less one of them dies in that case they  go and find a new mate.</p>

	<p style="position: relative;top: -1000px;width: 500px;left: -200px">On Santa Cruz island we spotted a barn swallow's nest that they were building on a beam in a barn. It was built with mud, small twigs, and grass. Barn swallow’s are a unique type of bird that build their nests on sides of mountains and buildings.
	Barn swallows are insectivores which means they mainly eat flying insects such as moths dragonflies and beetles. Insects are 99% of their diet. They lay 3-7 eggs at a time. The hatching survival rate is 90% and the fleeing survival rate is 70%.</p>
